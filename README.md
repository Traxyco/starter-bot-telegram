# [DEPRECATED]

This starter kit is deprecated. If you want to connect your bot to Telegram, please go on [Recast.AI website](https://recast.ai), go on your bot, and connect it to Twilio through `Run` tab > `Bot Connector`.

We recommend you to use our new Starter-kit to code your bot. You can choose one of those:

* [StarterKit NodeJS](https://github.com/RecastAI/starter-NodeJS)
* [StarterKit Python](https://github.com/RecastAI/starter-python)
* [StarterKit Ruby](https://github.com/RecastAI/starter-ruby)
* [StarterKit PHP](https://github.com/RecastAI/starter-PHP)

# Tutorial integration Telegram to Recast.AI bot

* This is a small Tutorial to show you how to integrate Telegram to a Recast.AI bot
* If you have no idea of how to use Recast.AI I advise you to check this SDK first:  [Recast.AI-nodejs-SDK](https://github.com/RecastAI/SDK-NodeJs)

## Requirements
* Create an account on [Recast.AI](https://recast.ai/signup)
* Download Telegram on your phone
* Configure your account on your phone
* Advise you to download [Telegram](https://desktop.telegram.org/) for a better dev exprience

## Set up your Recast.AI account

##### Create your bot

* Log in to your Recast.AI account
* Create a new bot

##### Get your token

* In your profile, click your bot
* In the tab-menu, click on the the little screw
* Here is the `request access token` you will need to configure your bot!

## Set up your Telegram account

##### Set the Telegram-bot

* Log in to your Telegram application on your (phone/desktop)
* Start a conversation with BotFather and say /newbot
* Follow the few step to create your bot
* Copy the token BotFather give you

## Start your bot in local
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RecastAI/bot-telegram.git
```

##### Complete the config.js

* Copy your Recast.AI `Recsat.AI access token`
* Copy your Telegram token `Token of your BOt`

```vim config.js```
```javascript
let config = {}
config.recast = {}
config.recast.request_token = 'RECAST-TOKEN'
config.recast.language = 'en' // to chose your language 'fr' or 'en'
config.telegram = {}
config.telegram.token = 'TELEGRAM-TOKEN'

module.exports = config
```
## Launching your Bot
```
npm install
npm start
```

### Your bot
* All you need for you bot is in the bot.js file. The call to Recast.AI is already done.
* ```client.textConverse(msg.text, { conversationToken: chatid })``` To use this method you need to pass the user's input, and  a unique conversation token. This token can be the message.chatid of the telegram chat. This token will create for each users a specific conversation with your bot.
* ```res.reply()``` To get the first reply of your bot.
* ```res.replies``` To get an array of all your replies.
* ``` res.action``` Get the object action. When an action is complete you will have the ```action.done = true ``` and you will be able to trigger a specific behavior.

```javascript
bot.on('message', msg => {
  const chatId = msg.chat.id
  client.textConverse(msg.text, { conversationToken: chatId }).then((res) => {
    const reply = res.reply()               /* To get the first reply of your bot. */
    const replies = res.replies             /* An array of all your replies */
    const action = res.action               /* Get the object action. You can use 'action.done' to trigger a specification action when it's at true. */

    if (!reply || !replies) {
      bot.sendMessage('i don\'t get it :(')
    } else {
      if (action && action.done === true) {
        console.log('action is done')
        // Use external services: use res.memory('notion') if you got a notion from this action
      }
      replies.forEach(rep => bot.sendMessage(chatId, rep))
    }
  })
})
```
